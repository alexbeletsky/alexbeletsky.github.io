<p>
The speech by two guys for <a href="http://xpinjection.com/">XPInjection.com</a> who shared they knowledge on such important Agile concept of Done. I was really interested in this speech since this is something that we also trying to use as common practice in our company. 
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Software development involves a lot people: developers, customers, management. And everybody has own &#8220;dreams&#8221; (or goals). Such differentiation of goals could lead to hidden (or opened) conflicts, misunderstanding of business and development, wrong communication and as a result - failure of project. But if we try to look it with another prospective, everybody is actually have one goal - delivery of product. Developers happy to see their work done, managers happy to see it is in budget and met customer criteria&#8217;s and so on. So in general everybody has one common goal. 
</p>
<p>
The way of managing one common understanding is the way of creation of Definition Of Done (DOD).
</p>
<h2>Typical scenarios caused by lack of DOD</h2>
<h3>&#8220;Uncommited stuff&#8221;</h3>
<p>
Developer declare work as done, but sources are not committed to SCM. Developers definition of done - it works on my machine. 
</p>
<h3>&#8220;Useless build&#8221;</h3>
<p>
Customer said - let&#8217;s deploy on production. Developer said - we still have a lot stuff to work on, merge, tests, DB migration scripts etc. Customer Done is different.
</p>
<h3>&#8220;Unstable velocity&#8221;</h3>
<p>
Customer - Well done, our velocity increased to 32 SP, let&#8217;s used for next fixed. Master - I have a lot small bugs to , documentation. Customer - how we change our velocity. Master - let&#8217;s say it is 20. Developers lack understanding of done.
</p>
<h3>&#8220;Unverified tasks&#8221;</h3>
<p>
Customer - there is a crash on form, have somebody tried to work before me. Developers - oops, it was quick fix, haven&#8217;t tested it well. I&#8217;ll just do another quick fix for that.
</p>
<h3>&#8220;Forgoten requirements&#8221;</h3>
<p>
Customer - my site is very slow, let&#8217;s discuss it on next meeting. Master - who did the performance testing? Aaaa.. no body. Non functional requirements are forgotten.
</p>
<h2>What is definition of Done?</h2>
<p>
Definition of Done: is a contract (number of rules) between different parties of how to treat particular actives state of completeness.
</p>
<h2>How to start?</h2>
<p>
If you decided to start with with DOD, you need some initial guidelines of implementation, what should you do to &#8220;define&#8221; DOD?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Take it from previous project (but it have to be done carefully, project are different)</li>
<li>Brainstorming, having code quality in mind (start from technical stuff)</li>
<li>Brainstorming, having business problems and wishes</li>
</ul>
<p>
The process of creation of DOD is brainstorming, you have to understand your need, you problems, your goals to create DOD.
</p>
<h2>Who should define</h2>
<p>
Team + Customer have to decide on definition of done.
</p>
<p>What usually happens, as for me, that DOD is created by Team only, because customer (or PO) is not really exited to do that, so this activity is usually skipped, but only understands the importance and consequences in case of major project issues. That&#8217;s why it is Scum Master job to involve customers (PO&#8217;s) as much as possible.</p>
<h2>When to define</h2>
<p>
Ideally at the start of the project. But in case of something wrong, you have to stop and re-implement definition of done, to prevent the problem. Retrospective is good time for changing DOD.
</p>
<h2>Where to store</h2>
<p>
Definition of done is document. Electronic versions is stored in SCM, on wiki site. Printed version have to be &#8216;before eyes&#8217; of Team/SM/PO. It is a good idea to put a copy near board, so everyone sees it on stand-up meeting etc.
</p>
<h2>Different levels of granularity</h2>
<p>
DOD could not cover all aspects of project. So it have to be granulated. DOF for Release, DOD Iteration, DOF for feature, DOF for task and so on.
</p>
<h2>How to control DOF</h2>
<h3>Automation</h3>
<p>
Automate everything you can - of possible try to automate rules from DOF (like using a hook in SVN to control comment). Add static analyzer to build (code quality).
</p>
<h3>Fixed workflow</h3>
<p>
Define a workflow in issue tracking system. As code review: workflow have to be changed to make a &#8216;Code review&#8217; as mandatory state.
</p>
<h3>Responsible persons</h3>
<p>
Execution of DOD is not possible without responsible persons. Scrum Master (person responsible for process), Team Leader, QA. It should be one person!
</p>
<h2>Typical problems</h2>
<ul>
<li>No common understanding - definition of Done have to be reviewed from time to time, to make everyone clear</li>
<li>No commitment - I understand it is imprortant.. but I ignore it. Everybody have to agree. Good idea is to show DOF for job candidates on interview</li>
<li>Unrealistic criteria - for instance 100% of code coverage</li>
<li>Too ideal DOD - you try thing about everything, it is hard to apply. From time to time, clean up DOD</li>
<li>Partially done tasks are accepted - typically on transion. this is a problem, don&#8217;t lie yourself</li>
<li>&#8220;Broken windows&#8221; principle - if someone start to ignore rule, eveybody start to ignore it</li>
<li>&#8220;Development only&#8221; DOF - care only about development side of process, forget rest (doc, QA, deployment)</li>

<p>
Speech by Timofey Yevgrashyn, the pioneer of Ukrainian Agile movement, shares his vision of the history of Agile in Ukraine.
</p>
<h2>Milestones</h2>
<ul>
<li>2001: Agile Manifesto signed, dotcom crash, outsourcing growth.. and many Ukrainian outsourcing companies appears</li>
<li>2005: First Scrum/XP projects in Ukraine, first certified Scrum Master</li>
<li>2007: First scrum meeting in Ukraine</li>
<li>2010: a lot of Agile conferences (Agileee, It jam, Agile base camp etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ukranian Agile</h2>
<p>
Timofey did a survey for gathering of information about actual Agile state in Ukraine, which he shared on his speach. Here a some facts of it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>300 Ukrainian CSM (Certified Scrum Master) from ~104000 of the world</li>
<li>Ukraine teams are the &#8220;industry average&#8221;</li>
<li>Weakest areas on Ukrainian teams: retrospectives, planning</li>
</ul>
<p>
Timofey emphasis that we have to move somewhere, but there is no new methodology. Agile is already &#8220;sold&#8221;.. but not implemented. So, a lot of shops are ready to adapt Agile practices and try to do that, but not right (eventually it ends up with blaming Agile that it does not work). Ukrainian Agile adopters have to avoid &#8220;cherry picking&#8221;, implement all required practices (by book, using Shu-approach).  
</p>
<p>
Allan Kelly were present on session did a several comments, that Ukrainian Agile people behave and do same mistake as in UK, as its in whole world. Later on he did very nice tweet: &#8220;#agileee Its reverse-Tolstoy again: All UnAgile teams are UnAgile in the same ways, all Agile teams are Agile in their own unique way&#8221;.

It also includes my subjective opinion on some topics. So it could not 100% reflects author opinion and original ideas. 
</small>
</p>
<p>
This speech has been done by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alovak">Pavel Gabriel</a> IT professional from Minks. Maybe it was influenced by Pavels not experienced to much for public speaking in English, but speech turns to be very generic, with a lot of obvious things and not really convincing.
</p>
<h2>The story</h2>
<p>
2 programmers 1 manager. Started without testers, after release user found a lot of bugs. The message from Boss was, that hiring a tester will help to improve problems. But Pavel has other opinion on that. Developers could solve quality problems by overselves.
</p>
<p>
So, Pavel initiated a process of improvements, for making accepted-quality products by developers only.
</p>
<h2>Right tools helps make things right</h2>
<p>
Team were using Ruby as it language and Ruby On Rails as their framework of choice. It is really influenced process, cause framework is done with TDD in mind, Ruby is dynamic language that makes it easy with unit testing, a lof already created solutions like Cucumber etc. But tools are not enough, there have to be something that change developers mind to care about quality, to be responsible for quality. 
</p>
<h2>Responsibility</h2>
<p>
Most issues is the because no responsibility in their actions. If there are testers, developers stop to test the application. Whole team is responsible for quality, all and no one. 
</p>
<p>
On Pavel&#8217;s opinion responsibility is gathered by Asking Questions, Code review, Demonstration.
</p>
<h2>Awareness</h2>
<p>
Team have to be aware of what is going on around. TDD/BDD is way of improvement of developer awareness. Retrospectives, to discuss progress and problems.
</p>
<p>
Doing a BDD with Cucumber make a developer really clear of what exactly is expected, what roles are involved. 
</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>
Communication is very important, so it is always a goal to improve communication.
</p>
<h2>Question and Answers</h2>
<p>
QnA session turns to be a nightmare :). 90% were out of context of speech, like &#8220;What tools do you use?&#8221;, &#8220;How you test pages?&#8221;, &#8220;How you do security tests?&#8221; and so on. I&#8217;ve tried to ask a common question, like &#8220;You try to did improvements, you convinced your boss you don&#8217;t need testers, developer could do testing.. what was the results? Number of bugs increased/decreased, customers started to be happy?&#8221;. An answer was, &#8220;Customers still unhappy, but users do not find critical bugs, exact statistics does not exists&#8221;. OK, fair enough. The idea of &#8220;testing by developers&#8221; turned out to be - give developers right tools to make them happy to do testing (TDD/BDD, acceptance), make them like to do that, as soon as they are happy they will produce better results. Also, everything depends on professionalism. So, we went back to old saying by Kent Beck - &#8220;XP is a team of Responsible professionals&#8221;, if people is not professional and responsible nothing will helps.
</p>
<p>
I personally like the idea of - create software by developers only. But as for me, it could work good only for small product shops (there customers are product creators actually). It does not fit big organization and outsourcing companies, mainly to to reasons above: in such organization there is just very low percentage of really professional developers.

<p>
Mary&#8217;s speech was quite long with a lot of details and information and it was quite hard to me to understand everything she said. Moreover I was sitting to far from scene, so hardly could see anything on screen. It is definitely not complete. If anyone has a presentation file it would be great to share it. Anyway, I put here what I caught so far.
</p>
<h2>Strategic Inflection Point</h2>
<p>
Mary introduces the concept of &#8220;Strategic Inflection Point&#8221;, as some point on timeframe for every organization were strategic decisions are made. Such decisions are vital for further organization development and growth. 
</p>
<h2>Strategic Inflection Point for Agile?</h2>
<p>
Agile has been created 10 years ago, it is quite old stuff.. and it is time to change!
</p>
<p>
The milestones of Agile could be described as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>version 1.0: processes and tools, comprehensive documentation, contract negotiation, follow plan</li>
<li>version 2.0: individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration</li>
<li>version 3.0: team vision and initiatives, validated learning, customer discovery, initiating change</li>
</ul>
<p>
Mary emphasis that now it is time for Management version 3.0!
</p>
<p>
Let&#8217;s try to review key points for version 3.0.
</p>
<h2>
Team vision and initiatives
</h2>
<p>
&#8220;There is nothing useless as efficiently that which should not be done at all&#8221; - Petter Ducrker.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Most products failures are caused by lack of customers.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Bring the team to customers, to understand that actually customer wants.
</p>
<p>
Mary introduces concept of MVP, Minimum Viable Product. It is something with minimal scope that could run to see actual customer demand - does it do the job? Will customers pay for it? What do we need to learn next? You have to measure and repeat.
Experiment -> Learn -> Adjust!
</p>
<p>
And it is vital to make sure that you are building right think and that make sure, that it is build right! 
</p>
<h2>Customer discovery</h2>
<p>
It is like ethnography - watch persons! what do they do, learn it! Try to understand what is happening. Ideation - do prototypes, do iteration. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Brilliant Systems are result of matching of mental models between those developing a system and those who will be using the system.&#8221;
</p>
<h2>
Initiation change
</h2>
<p>
Just making a change happen. Every iteration is vital to make sure that customers see results and giving feedback on that. If you know that customer download your software every month, you&#8217;ll to make it stable! Make what customers wants, not what promised to executives.. the change is coming from team, by elaborating customers feedbacks. 
</p>
<p>
Extra features are biggest waste in Software development! 45% of features is never used..
Write less code! Developers productivity - less code, less features. 
</p>
<p>
Later in twitter I&#8217;ve seen a link to new Mary&#8217;s book regarding <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321712471?ie=UTF8&tag=noopnl-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321712471">Management 3.0</a>, that you might be interesting to.

<p>
First session on Agileee 2010. Due to its name I thought it will be yet another lecture of Agile/Scrum etc. It was, but <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/henrikkniberg">Henrik</a> make it really interesting, detailed. I&#8217;ve heard a lot of new things there. So far it is my favorite speech on conf. 
</p>
<h2>Beginning</h2>
<p>
I&#8217;m scarred now :) - the words <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/henrikkniberg">Henrik</a> started. But all his speech were clear and fluent.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
All current agile abbreviations make us to confuse. Scrum, Kanban, XP, TDD and so on. What is about, what problems it tries to solve?
</p>
<p>
Doing a software projects could be compared to shooting a goal by cannon ball. There are Goal and Cannon.. and only one shot. After shot we hope, we launch a target. That&#8217;s why we try to do all planning, risk management and all other &#8220;do before&#8221; stuff. But the issue is - target is moving with time, so we always miss. 
</p>
<p>
Taking into account percentage of successful and failed projects through the last years. Henrik gives such figures:
</p>
Success of projects:
<ol>
<li>
Year 1994 - 15% of success
</li>
<li>
Year 2004 - 34% of success
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So, we definitely learned something thought 10 years. So, what was the problems, what we&#8217;ve learned so far?
</p>
<h2>Estimations</h2>
<p>Different people, within different context, with slightly different input do different estimations. Henrik gives some really nice examples, than estimation double only by fact that spec is wrote in bigger number of pages, or includes some irrelevant details, or contains different items.
<p>
Let&#8217;s put it really simple - we are all could not do an estimations! We could actually, but our estimations sucks. A lot of project treated to be failed, as they haven&#8217;t been met original estimations.
</p>
<p>
But they are number of successful projects increases? Because, project gotten a lot smaller and (there is no silver bullet), but Agile is something that improved the situation. Why?
</p>
<ul>
<li>User involvement</li>
<li>Executive management support</li>
<li>Clear business objectives</li>
<li>Optimizing scope</li>
</ul>
<h2>Agile in nutshell</h2>
<ol>
<li>Customer discover that they want</li>
<li>Developers discover how to build</li>
<li>Responding to change is vital(to track moving goal)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Agile approach to planning</h2>
<p>
So, if we are not able to do exact estimations and to do exact plans, whats our approach for planning should be?
</p>
<p>Agile principles: early delivery. If we late with release we have to at least deliver most important features at planned time.
Releases have to be short. Henrik gives nice metaphor: if we wait for train that goes every 5 minutes, it is not big deal for us if we miss it. We just wait for 5 minutes and go to train. It it goes every 30 minutes, it will annoy us but we still could wait. But let&#8217;s consider a ship that goes for another city once in week or once in month. We miss it, we are in trouble.
</p>
<p>
Having a releases to be short, we act like a 5 minutes train.
</p>
<h2>Scrum in nutshell</h2>
<p>
Scrum tries to split the things. Organization split to teams, product split to backlog items, time split to iterations. Deliver ever sprint is key factor.
</p>
<p>
Scrum defines different roles for people in team, they are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Stakeholders: users, helpdesk, customers</li>
<li>Product Owner: one who define a vision and priorities</li>
<li>Team: group of people responsible how much to pull in, how to build</li>
<li>Scrum master: one who responsible for process leadership and coaching</li>
</ul>
<p>
Definition of done, plays important role in Scrum. It have to be clearly defined by team. What exacly have to be done, to treat some particular work is done (tested, merged, release noted and so on).
</p>
<p>
How to estimate? Don&#8217;t estimate time, estimate by people who do work, estimate continuously. Planning poker is a nice agile estimation technique.
</p>
<p>
Sprint planning, Daily scrum (make a process to be white box, not a black box), something to come out, Demo (looking into product), Retrospective (looking to process).
</p>
<h2>XP in nutshell</h2>
<p>
Scrum wraps XP. Scrum don&#8217;t know nothing about programming, XP does.. it introduce engineering practices. Scrum + XP is great combination (but is not really required).
</p>
<p>
XP contains a number of practicies, but most important are - Pair programming: short feedback loop (seconds). Unit tests: short feedback loop (minutes), Continuously integration: short feedback loop (hours). 
</p>
<h2>Agile architecture</h2>
<p>
It might seem that Agile don&#8217;t care about architecture, since there are no value in architecture. It is partially true. Agile is goal oriented, oriented to do things quickly, to release quickly, to fail quickly.
</p>
<p>
Quick&#8217;n&#8217;dirty turns to be Slow&#8217;n&#8217;dirty. If you don&#8217;t care on architecture at all and do patch style of programming, you are in trouble after awhile. It would be just too difficult to extend and maintain the product.  
</p>
<p>
On other hand, big upfront design works could make customers unhappy. To much spend on thinking about beautiful architecture with no actual output (remember that Working Software is major Agile metric of progress).
</p>
<p>
It have to be balanced. Architecture have to be simple, as simple architecture is as simple code is. Clean and simple code is very important. But code is not an asset, code is cost. Only some code is value. Simple code is easy to change. 
</p>
<p>What is definition of Simple code? Simple code is one that all of there requirements</p>
<ol>
<li>All tests passed</li>
<li>No duplication</li>
<li>Readable</li>
<li>Minimal</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, such criteria&#8217;s as readability and minimalism is subjective, different people could have different opinion on that. But team have to share same vision.</p>
<h2>Kanban in nutshell</h2>
<p>
Kanban is a way of visualization of work. Kanban - visual card. David Anderson, visualized of flow. See board, talk near board.
</p>
<p>
Board could consist of such sections: Backlog, Next, Dev (Ongoing, Done), Acceptance (Ongoing, Done), In production. It is great to see that Next could be empty. Analysis of board is a way of project management with Kanban. Don&#8217;t put to much, don&#8217;t pull to much. Printer jam - don&#8217;t put more paper. Theory of constraints is applied doing a projects with Kanban.
</p>
<h2>Comparing methodologies</h2>
<p>
The comparing have to be done only with one goal - undestanding. It is like compare knife to fork, it doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense to compare tools, decide what tool is best for to solve problem. 
</p>
<p>
Comparison by a number of rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>More prescriptive: XP (13), RUP(120+)</li>
<li>More adaptive: Kanban (3), Do Whatever (0)</li>
<li>In a middle: Scrum (9)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Approach to use any new methodologies</h2>
<p>
Henrik gives a really nice explanation of how to approach a thing. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari">Shuhari</a>. It cames form Japaneses martial arts, I liked that a lot, since I&#8217;m fan of karate :).
</p>
<ul>
<li>Shu - follow the process (shut up and listen to master)</li>
<li>Ha - adapt the process, innovate the process</li>
<li>Ri - never mind the process, forget the process, create your process</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<P>
At the end of session Henrik did several known (but usually forgotten) priciples to follow.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use right tools - chose exactly what you need, it could be difficult, mistakes could happen here</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be dogmatic - don&#8217;t treat any practice as dogma, because it is not dogma, reach Ri level of learning</li>
</ul>
<p>
Perfection is direction, not a place - don&#8217;t forget it!

<p>
First of all I would like to say thank you to my <a href="http://e-conomic.com">company</a> to be at this conference. It is really great to be part of such community, to see a lot of famous faces, to listen to a wise speeches.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ll share my overall impressions on this conference as well as some keynotes for sessions I attend.
</p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>
Registration were fine and easy, no waiting lines, no crowd. Just gave my registration letter and got lunch tickets for both days as well as big bag. Then I looked in bag I found a lot of interesting stuff in it! There was a map of Kiev (I live in Kiev, but I believe that guests find it very useful), notepad, pens, some advs. What I really liked is notebook stickers by <a href="http://www.versionone.com/">VersionOne</a> (that I already put on my notebook :) and planning poker cards by <a href="http://www.globallogic.com/">GlobalLogic</a>. Also, I was quite surprised to see that I represent Nigeria on Agileee 2010 :). So, organizators were in good humor.

<h2>Morning coffee</h2>
<p>
Since I was in really big hurry I was happy to see I still have time before Opening Session. All guests could enjoy morning coffee and tea, listening to some classic tunes played by a small orchestra. During the coffee it was great to see such guests as <a href="">Mary Poppendieck</a>, <a href="http://www.allankelly.net/">Allan Kelly</a> and others.

<h2>Opening Session</h2>
<p>
Time to begin! <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alexeykri">Alexey Krivitsky</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/NataliyaTrenina">Natalia Trenina</a> are major people on scene! Introduction speach were nice and clean, even it has been bit messed up with microphone issues that took place. Anyway, Agileee 2010 is opened, so it is time for speakers to do their work!

<h2>Sessions</h2>
<p>
I really enjoyed some sessions, some was boring as for me. Having a notebook on my knees I tried to do as much notes as possible, so I&#8217;m planning to do a small review of each session I visisited. So my channel is going to be a little noisy next several days, but please stay in tune :). 
</p>
<h2>
My little feedback on organization.
</h2>
<p>
The organization is really great, keep doing that guys :). What I personally complain about are: bad quality of WiFi connection, and few plugs to recharge of notebook&#8217;s battery.

Using a Regex is pretty easy in .NET applications. All you have to use is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.regularexpressions.regex.aspx">Regex</a> object and have basic understanding of regular expression patterns. 
</p>
<p>
My goal was to create a code, that would give an answer: does this particular text contain some words from dictionary or not? Using a regular expressions is an obvious choice then you do such type of operation. So, I was trying to understand what technology is demanded by job offer (Cpp, Java or .NET) and is TDD skill demanded. To archive that I created a set of &#8220;matchers&#8221; small classes each of its own area. Crawler just used those matchers to get actual data.  
</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">protected</font> <font color="#0000ff">bool</font> MatchToTdd(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> description)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> <font color="#0000ff">new</font> TddMatcher().Match(description);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">protected</font> <font color="#0000ff">bool</font> MatchToJava(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> desciption)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> <font color="#0000ff">new</font> JavaMatcher().Match(desciption);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">protected</font> <font color="#0000ff">bool</font> MatchToCpp(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> desciption)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> <font color="#0000ff">new</font> CppMatcher().Match(desciption);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">protected</font> <font color="#0000ff">bool</font> MatchToDotNet(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> desciption)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> <font color="#0000ff">new</font> DotNetMatcher().Match(desciption);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br></font><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
<p>
As you see, I have 4 matchers to cover my requirements: <em>CppMatcher</em>, <em>DotNetMatcher</em>, <em>JavaMatcher</em>, <em>TddMatcher</em>. All of them implements simple <em>IMatcher</em> interface.
</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black"><font color="#0000ff">namespace</font> Crawler.Core.Matchers<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">interface</font> IMatcher<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">bool</font> Match(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> input);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}<br></font><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
<p>
Now, let&#8217;s review the matcher. Because all the matchers do basically the same operations and differ only but its dictionary contents, they contain a dictionary of target words and delegates matching functionality to <em>MatchUtil</em> class. Let&#8217;s see C++ matcher for instance.
</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black"><font color="#0000ff">namespace</font> Crawler.Core.Matchers<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">class</font> CppMatcher : IMatcher<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">private</font> <font color="#0000ff">static</font> IList&#60;<font color="#0000ff">string</font>&#62; _patterns = <font color="#0000ff">new</font> <font color="#2B91AF">List</font>&#60;<font color="#0000ff">string</font>&#62;()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#A31515">"c\\+\\+"</font>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#A31515">"cpp"</font>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#A31515">"stl"</font>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#A31515">"cppunit"</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">bool</font> Match(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> input)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> MatchUtil.Match(input, _patterns);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}</font><br><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
<p>
I wanted to design <em>MatchUtil.Match</em> to be universal, as much as possible and to do not depend on kind of input words. Matching words with boundaries &#8220;\b&#8221; works perfecly, as soon as you have a simple words, like &#8216;java&#8217;, &#8216;nunit&#8217;, &#8216;tests&#8217; and so on, but my tests stated to fail as soon as I tried &#8216;c++&#8217; or &#8216;.net&#8217;. Because of &#8216;\b&#8217; matches boudary between 2 alphanumeric symbols, in my case &#8216;+&#8217; or &#8216;.&#8217; is not alphanumeric. That made a problem to me and asked <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3641985/regex-to-match-a-word-with-plus-signs">StackOverflow</a> for help. I finished up with such implementation, that I hope could be useful if you do similar stuff.
</p>
<blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black"><font color="#0000ff">namespace</font> Crawler.Core.Matchers<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">class</font> MatchUtil<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">static</font> <font color="#0000ff">bool</font> Match(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> input, IList&#60;<font color="#0000ff">string</font>&#62; patterns)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> lower = input.ToLower();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">foreach</font> (<font color="#0000ff">var</font> pattern <font color="#0000ff">in</font> patterns)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> start = pattern.StartsWith(<font color="#A31515">"\\."</font>) ? <font color="#A31515">"(?!\\w)"</font> : <font color="#A31515">"\\b"</font>;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">if</font> (Regex.IsMatch(lower, start + pattern + <font color="#A31515">"(?!\\w)"</font>))<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> <font color="#0000ff">true</font>;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> <font color="#0000ff">false</font>;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}<br></font><br><font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote>
<p>
So, <em>Regex.IsMatch</em> static method is used to perform match. 
</p>
<p>
This is it. If you see some issues or improvements, please let me know. <a href="http://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/TddDemand">http://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/TddDemand</a>

<h1>Introduction</h1><p>This is a first post of small series that I&#8217;m going to describe implementation and design of Crawler, that I&#39;ve      done recently for <a href="http://www.beletsky.net/2010/09/is-tdd-skill-actually-required-by.html">TDD demand analisys</a>. I would split it up into several parts, covering its major architectural parts. </p><ul><li> Part 1 - Crawling a web sites with HtmlAgilityPack </li>
<li> Part 2 - Regex to match a words in dictionary on page body </il><br />
<li> Part 3 - EF4 Code First approach to store data </li><br />
<br />
</ul><p>For references, you could use a source code - <a href="http://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/tdd.demand">http://github.com/alexanderbeletsky/tdd.demand</a> </p><p><small><em>Warning</em> it&#8217;s quite long post, cause contain code examples, if you understand basic ideas I put here, best way it to go directly to repository and see the code, as best explanation material</small> </p><h1>Using HtmlAgilityPack</h1><p><a href="http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/">HtmlAgilityPack</a> is one of the great open sources projects I ever worked with. It is a HTML parser for .NET applications, works with great performance, supports malformed HTML. I successfully used in one of the projects and really liked it. It contains very few documentation, but it designed so well that you can get basic understanding just by looking to Visual Studio Object Browser. </p><p>So, then you need to deal with HTML in .NET - <a href="http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/">HtmlAgilityPack</a> is a definitely framework of choice.  </p><p>I&#8217;ve downloaded latest version and were very pleased that now it supports Linq to Objects. That makes usage of HtmlAgilityPack more simple and fun. I&#8217;ll give you just a simple idea how it works. Task of every crawler is to extract some information from particular html page. Say, we need to get inner text from div element with class &#8220;required&#8221;. We have a 2 options here, classical one, using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/">XPATH</a> and brand new, using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397919.aspx">Linq to Objects</a>. </p><h3>XPATH approach</h3><p><blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black"><font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">string</font> GetInnerTestWithXpath() { &nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> document = <font color="#0000ff">new</font> HtmlDocument(); &nbsp;&nbsp;document.Load(<font color="#0000ff">new</font> <font color="#2B91AF">FileStream</font>(<font color="#A31515">"test.html"</font>, <font color="#2B91AF">FileMode</font>.Open));  &nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> node = document.DocumentNode.SelectSingleNode(<font color="#A31515">@"//div[@class="</font><font color="#A31515">"required"</font><font color="#A31515">"]"</font>); &nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> node.InnerText; } </font> <font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code>

Now, our goal is to load pages by URL using HTTP. .NET framework has a special <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webrequest.aspx">WebRequest</a>. I&#8217;ve created a separate class <em>HtmlDocumentLoader</em> (that implements IHtmlDocumentLoader interface) that all the details inside.  </p><blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black"><font color="#0000ff">using</font> System; <font color="#0000ff">using</font> System.Collections.<font color="#2B91AF">Generic</font>; <font color="#0000ff">using</font> System.Linq; <font color="#0000ff">using</font> System.Text; <font color="#0000ff">using</font> System.Net; <font color="#0000ff">using</font> System.Threading;  <font color="#0000ff">namespace</font> Crawler.Core.Model { &nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">public</font> <font color="#0000ff">class</font> HtmlDocumentLoader : IHtmlDocumentLoader &nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">private</font> WebRequest CreateRequest(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> url) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;request.Timeout = 5000;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;request.UserAgent = <font color="#A31515">@"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5"</font>; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> request; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">public</font> HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument LoadDocument(<font color="#0000ff">string</font> url) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">var</font> document = <font color="#0000ff">new</font> HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument();  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">try</font> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">using</font> (<font color="#0000ff">var</font> responseStream = CreateRequest(url).GetResponse().GetResponseStream()) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.Load(responseStream, <font color="#2B91AF">Encoding</font>.UTF8); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">catch</font>(Exception )  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#008000">//just do a second try</font> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thread.Sleep(1000); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">using</font> (<font color="#0000ff">var</font> responseStream = CreateRequest(url).GetResponse().GetResponseStream()) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;document.Load(responseStream, <font color="#2B91AF">Encoding</font>.UTF8); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">return</font> document; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} &nbsp;&nbsp;} } </font> <font size="1" color="gray">* This source code was highlighted with <a href="http://virtser.net/blog/post/source-code-highlighter.aspx"><font size="1" color="gray">Source Code Highlighter</font></a>.</font></code></blockquote><p>Several comments here. First, You can see that we load UserAgent property of WebRequest. We are making our request look that same as it would be a Firefox web browser. Some web servers could prevent web requests from &#8220;unknown&quot;      agents, so this is kind of preventive action. Second, is how document object is being intialized.. as you might see we have a try/catch block here and just repeat the same initialization steps in catch block. It might happen that web server fails to process requirest (due to different reasons), so WebRequest object will throw and exception. We just wait for one second and retry it. I&#8217;ve noticed that such simple approach could really improve robustness of crawler.   </p><h1>Generic Crawler</h1><p>So, now we know how to load HTML documents by using of WebRequest, specifying document URL, also we know how to use HtmlAgilityPack to extract data from a document. Now, we have to create an engine, that would automatically go through the document, extract the links for next portion of data, process data and store it. That is something that is called crawler. </p><p>As I implemented and tested several crawlers, I&#8217;ve seen that all off them have the same structure and operations and differs only in particular details of how data is extracted from pages. So, I came up with a generic crawler, implemented as abstract class. If you need to build next crawler you just inherit generic crawler and implement all abstract operations. Let&#8217;s see the heart of crawler, StartCrawling() method.  </p><blockquote><code><font size="2" face="Courier New" color="black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">protected</font> <font color="#0000ff">virtual</font> <font color="#0000ff">void</font> StartCrawling() &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logger.Log(BaseUrl + <font color="#A31515">" crawler started..."</font>);

This is a follow up for my last blog post, that I showed some data gathered by crawler, to check out how much TDD skill is valuable for development shops, how much do they ask for it in offers? As you remember I was satisfied with a quality of data provided by <a href="http://prgjobs.com">prgjobs.com</a>.  
</p>
<p>
Today, I was reading a blog post from a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/09/go-that-way-really-fast.html">Coding Horrow</a> and understood that I missed one good source of information, that is <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/Jobs">StackOverflow Careers</a> 
</p>
<p>
Due to the latest architectural changes I&#8217;ve made to Crawler and well structure of Careers, it took about hour to create new crawler and test it. Now, I&#8217;m ready to share the data.
</p>
<h2>Careers.StackOverflow results</h2>
<p>
Here we go - 212 vacancies has been extracted from this site. 49 of them were requesting TDD (23%, not so bad). 
</p>

<h2>
Conclusions
</h2>
<p>
For sure, it is more correct data. We can see that results are really close the one we&#8217;ve got for Ukrainian market, by analysis of <a href="http://rabota.ua">rabotaua</a> site. It also make it possible to make some generalization of results.
</p>
<p>
We could say that ~20% of employers are demanding on TDD skill. Rest of employers either do not mention it in applications or do not care about such skill at all.
</p>
<p>
Ciprian Mustiata gave nice point in comments for previous post, that such demand on TDD could be reasonable for countries like Ukraine, where major market is for maintenance of existing code base (typically legacy code, no tests). But we see similar figures for USA, country where a lot of brand new product born.
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s another piece of information to think about. What&#8217;s your opinion on that?

<p>
Is TDD popular among developers? Do managers knows about benefits of TDD? Are employers really looking for TDD skilled people? 
</p>
<p>
I was thinking about such kind of questions and decided to perform my initial research. My research was quite simple, I wanted to check popular job looking sites and review latest job offers, especially for &#8220;skills&#8221; sections. How many of employers actually seek for developers who know/use/love TDD. Since I&#8217;m geek I would not do it manually, so I&#8217;ve written an application for that. Crawler that could get data from job looking sites and store it to DB for further analisys. I already got the data and would like to share it in this post.    
</p>
<h2>How it works?</h2>
<p>
Like any other crawler it has one big cycle that makes a web requests to site, 
    gets response, extracts the links and data from response, stores data somewhere. It proceeds as soon as relevant data is present on pages. Vacancy crawler does a search request, extracts links for all vacancy pages. As soon as link extracted, it does request to vacancy page. It analyzes the body of vacancy description by very simple method: searching for a keywords it text. So, to detect is TDD skill required or not, crawler try to match some words from vocabulary. 
    Similar approach used to understand what technology skills (.NET, Java, C++) is required. At final it creates a record contains site name, position, technology used and TDD demand flag and stores data to database. 
</p>
<h2>Source of information</h2>
<p>
I&#8217;ve taken two sites as source of information. First, <a href="http://rabota.ua">RabotaUa</a> (Ukrainian one, Ukraine is 
    one of big players of IT outsourcing in Europe, so data will be really relevant). Second one, I wanted to pick up from USA, but it was difficult to find it, since I&#8217;m not aware of its popularity, reputation and so on. I even asked question of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3645579/developers-job-looking-site-in-us-closed">StackOverflow</a>, but my question was closed. I choose <a href="http://www.prgjobs.com">JobsForProgrammers</a> as one of google suggested.
</p>
<h2>RabotaUa results</h2>
<p>
I&#8217;ve extracted 978 records from <a href="http://rabota.ua">RabotaUa</a>. It is latest, actual, recently posted job offers. 150 of 987 vacancies contained requirements for TDD skills.
</p>

<h2>PrgJobs results</h2>
<p>
I&#8217;ve extracted 1000 records from <a href="http://www.prgjobs.com">JobsForProgrammers</a>. Crawler could proceed more, but I&#8217;ve noticed that on latest pages, site contains not really relevant data, not developers jobs and offers with short and not always adequate description. So, I still consider to crawle some other USA site for data. Anyway, here are results. Only 69 of 1000 requires TDD, 7%! 
</p>
<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_stL4bIIuRUs/TIkhupQmI2I/AAAAAAAAG44/xi8kA_k-NE4/s1600/prgjob.pie.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 217px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_stL4bIIuRUs/TIkhupQmI2I/AAAAAAAAG44/xi8kA_k-NE4/s400/prgjob.pie.png" border="0" alt=""id="Img2" /></a>
<p>
Technologies breakdown, also a bit strange. Match for technology were difficult, for several reasons. Job description headline, usually contained to generic description (as Software Developer, Web developer and so on), job description body contained multiskills requirements (like C++/Perl, or C#/Java, VB.NET/Java) that current version of crawler could not handle properly.
</p>
<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_stL4bIIuRUs/TIkix2ebWKI/AAAAAAAAG5A/zHGGiqCGGaQ/s1600/prgjob.chart.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 217px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_stL4bIIuRUs/TIkix2ebWKI/AAAAAAAAG5A/zHGGiqCGGaQ/s400/prgjob.chart.png" border="0" alt=""id="Img3" /></a>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
To be honest, I would not expect such data. I thought 40-60% should ask for TDD, but we see that it is less than 16% from 
    Ukranian data source and less than 7% for USA. For me, as TDD follower this is really disappointing results.  I realize that such results are very simple and rough, could not be used for some real life analytics, but it gives 
    a vision, for sure.    
</p>
<p>
Also I plan to do several technical blogs with details of implementation of Crawler, I&#8217;ve created for this report.
</p>
<p>
Please let me know, what you think about such results, what further improvements could be done for more fine results, what other data sources could be used?
